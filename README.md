# Option1 - Pragmatic Window Manager for macOS

The idea - binding shortcuts like `⌥-1`, `⌥-2` for windows you need.

Try it now. Press `⌥-1` to open Safari, `⌥-2` to open Calendar app.

I call it pragmatic because I focus on features I miss on build-in macOS window management.

It is not a replacement but an addition to the built-in macOS window management.

Customize it for yourself on the `Shared` tab.
