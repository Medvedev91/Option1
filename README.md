# Option1 - Pragmatic Window Manager for macOS

The idea - to bind shortcuts like `⌥-1`, `⌥-2` for windows you need.

Try it now. Press `⌥-1` to open Calendar app, `⌥-2` to open Notes app. This is the default Option1 settings.

## todo docs

First of all, it is pragmatic. It is not a replacement for the built-in macOS window management, but an addition.

Customize it for yourself on the `Shared` tab.
