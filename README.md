# Option1 - Pragmatic Window Manager for macOS

The idea - binding shortcuts like `⌥-1`, `⌥-2` to windows you need.

Press `⌥-1` to open Safari, and `⌥-2` to open Calendar app. Customize it for yourself.

## Feature - Windows

Let's say we have two windows for one app, like two Xcode projects. We cannot open the window we need with built-in `⌘-Tab` because macOS opens apps, not windows. Let's solve this with Option1.

Look at the screenshot:

- for `⌥-3` I bind `Xcode` with `Option1` title,
- for `⌥-4` I bind `Xcode` with `timeto.me` title.

This means `⌥-3` opens Xcode window with `Option1` in the title, and `⌥-4` with `timeto.me`. Solved!

## My Personal Advice 

I call it pragmatic because I focus on the features I miss in macOS. It is not a replacement but an addition to the built-in macOS window management.
